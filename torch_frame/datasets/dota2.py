    <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/367/dota2+games+results>`_
    dataset. Dota2 is a popular moba game with two teams of 5 players.
    At start of the game, each player choose a unique hero with
    different strengths and weakness. The dataset is reasonably sparse
    as only 10 of 113 possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All
    games were played in a space of 2 hours on the 13th of August 2016.
    The classification goal is to predict the winning team.
